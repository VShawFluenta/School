These are words. 
In the first ever knockout race in sailing at an Olympic Games, Italy's Marta Maggetti came from behind in the medal race to win gold at Paris 2024 ahead of Israel's reigning world champion Sharon Kantor. A distraught Emma Wilson from Team GB won bronze after initially leading.

Wilson had progressed straight through to the iQFOiL final having topped the opening series.

The second and third-placed athletes, Kantor and Maggetti, meanwhile, headed into the semi-finals. They would then compete against the two who would progress from the quarter finals, which were those athletes placed 4-10 in the opening series.

The quarter-finals kicked off the day in dramatic fashion with the two athletes languishing at the back of the pack in the early stages, Yan Zheng of People's Republic of China and Peru's Maria Bazo, took a gamble, splitting off to the left of the course where they caught the breeze, bypassing the leaders to take the two top spots.

They were unable to pull off the same trick in the semi-final, however, where Kantor and Maggetti progressed to the medal race, where they would face Wilson, all knowing an Olympic medal was secured but not kowing which colour would be theirs.

All three crossed the startline cleanly, with Team GB's Wilson taking the lead, with Kantor in second, and Italy third.

Wilson erred when opting to extend one of the legs in order to get a better run at the mark, but that left her out of position. Maggetti, meanwhile, decided she had nothing to lose and split from the other two racers, and by the time she rejoined, was in the lead.

The race had been upended with Maggetti now leading, Kantor in second, and Wilson, in third.

And this is how it stayed until race end with Maggetti claiming gold at her second Olympic Games, coming in the dreaded fourth place in Tokyo - and securing Italy's first sailing gold since Sydney 2000. Kantor secured silver, Israel's first sailing medal since Beijing 2008.

“I don’t know man, so, so happy. I did a really good week. I was so focused today. I really wanted this medal so I don’t know what to say," said a beaming Maggetti.

“It’s a million dreams. My family, all the guys who watch me every year, the team. Thanks to my army, it’s amazing.”

Wilson secured back-to-back Olympic bronze medals after also taking bronze in the RS:X discipline in Japan, and a smile only broke through after her brother said something to make her laugh when she got back to dry land and a well-needed hug.

“I’m pretty gutted," said the Brit. "Obviously, an Olympic medal is amazing, and soon I’ll probably be happy, but I don’t know, I made some mistakes today. I’ve done it before, so I guess it just hurts a bit more because I keep doing it.”
